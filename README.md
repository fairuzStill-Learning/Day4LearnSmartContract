This what i learn in day four

## What I Learn?  

### Inheritance  
so inheritance is like featuring from one contract to another contract, so we can use function on one contract in another contract or add more functions  

### virtual and override 
this keyword is lil bit same like inheritance for me tho, so **vitrual** is a keyword that can declared functions as virtual, which means this functions can be **overridden** by another functions in another contract and we can add more uses to the functions declared as overridden.
